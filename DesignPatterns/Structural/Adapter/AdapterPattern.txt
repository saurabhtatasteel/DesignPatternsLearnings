Adapter pattern acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This pattern involves a single class called adapter which is responsible for communication between two independent or incompatible interfaces.

For Example: A card reader acts as an adapter between a memory card and a laptop. You plugins the memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop.

The classes, interfaces, and objects used are as follows:

ITarget
This is an interface which is used by the client to achieve its functionality/request.

Adapter
This is a class which implements the ITarget interface and inherits the Adaptee class. It is responsible for communication between Client and Adaptee.

Adaptee
This is a class which has the functionality, required by the client. However, its interface is not compatible with the client.

Client
This is a class which interacts with a type that implements the ITarget interface. However, the communication class called adaptee, is not compatible with the client
