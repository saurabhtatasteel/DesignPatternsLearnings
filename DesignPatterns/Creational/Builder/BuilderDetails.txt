Builder pattern falls under the category of Creational design pattern. Builder pattern builds a complex object by using a step by step approach. Builder Interface defines the steps/methods
to build the final product. This builder is independent of the object creation process.
There are four entities in it - 
	Builder - An interface that lists the steps to create an object (IMenuBuilder)
	Director - That directs what to do in steps (Director)
	Product/Object - The final object or product to be created (Menu)
	ConcreteBuilder classes - This class actually keeps the actual logic to create the specific product. (Menu1Builder)

	Client - It makes use of director to ask for object creation process.


When to use this?

When we need to create a complex object in several steps (step by step approach)
