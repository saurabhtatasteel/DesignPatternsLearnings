Prototype design pattern is used to create a duplicate object or clone of the current object to enhance performance. This pattern is used when the creation of an object is costly or complex.

For Example, An object is to be created after a costly database operation. We can cache the object, returns its clone on next request and update the database as and when needed thus reducing database calls.

For shallow cloning, MemberwiseClone() method can be used
For deep cloning, serialization can be used
