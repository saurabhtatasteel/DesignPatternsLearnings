Suppose there is a creditcard product which needs to be built. There are multiple CreditCards to be built. Who should hold the responsibility to create creditCard product.

CreditCard product creation should not be done by client and indeed it should be designated to a different source for creating a product based on client demand.
For achieving this, we can have a class in which there can be multiple switch cases based on which the product can be created.
But implementing it in a single class would break the 'O' principle of SOLID because in future if a new product would come then logic of creating that new product will have to be included there in the same class.

Due to this, every product creation responsiblity should be handled by the respective product's factory. In our example, we have different Factory classes for the respective products.

FactoryMethodClient demonstrates the way client can instantiate the particular product to make use of it.
